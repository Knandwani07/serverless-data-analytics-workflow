# 📊 AWS Data Exchange: Serverless Data Analytics Workflow

AWS Data Exchange: Serverless Data Analytics Workflow is a real-world, serverless data analytics walkthrough using core AWS services like **AWS Data Exchange**, **Amazon S3**, and **Amazon Athena**. This project demonstrates how to discover public datasets, subscribe to them, export to S3, and perform powerful SQL-based queries using Athena, all with minimal infrastructure and maximum insight.

## 🌐 Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Showcase the simplicity and power of **AWS Data Exchange** in accessing third-party data.
- Guide users through a **no-code/low-code** flow for querying and analyzing public datasets.
- Demonstrate the serverless synergy between **S3**, **Athena**, and **Data Exchange** in a practical use case.
- Promote best practices for building scalable and efficient **data pipelines** using AWS-native tools.

## 🔁 Flow Overview

This project follows a structured data processing and analysis pipeline:

### 1. **Subscribe to a Public Dataset**
- Use AWS Data Exchange to subscribe to **Enigma's COVID-19 dataset (JHU CSSE)**.

### 2. **Export Data to S3**
- Export the dataset revision directly to an **Amazon S3 bucket**.

### 3. **Query Using Amazon Athena**
- Create an external table in Athena linked to the S3 path.
- Run SQL queries to analyze COVID-19 data at scale.

## ✅ Key Benefits

- 🔄 **Serverless Workflow** – No servers to manage; everything runs on AWS-managed services.
- ⚡ **Fast Insights** – Athena enables rapid SQL querying without ETL.
- 📦 **Plug & Play Datasets** – AWS Data Exchange lets you access third-party data in minutes.
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** – Each step (subscribe, export, query) is loosely coupled for flexibility.
- 💰 **Cost-Effective** – Pay only for what you query and store.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- An active **AWS Account**
- Permissions for:
  - **AWS Data Exchange**
  - **Amazon S3**
  - **Amazon Athena**
- Basic knowledge of SQL (for Athena queries)

---

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this project, you will:

- Know how to navigate and subscribe to datasets via **AWS Data Exchange**.
- Learn how to **export datasets to S3** for long-term use.
- Create **Athena tables and run analytical queries** over large datasets.
- Understand how **serverless data lakes** work using native AWS tools.
- Get hands-on experience with **real-world datasets** (e.g., COVID-19).

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

This hands-on project proves that working with large, third-party datasets in AWS doesn’t have to be complicated. With the power of **AWS Data Exchange**, **Amazon S3**, and **Athena**, you can build robust, scalable, and cost-effective data workflows in minutes not hours. Whether you're a beginner exploring data or an enterprise building data-driven products, this demo gives you a solid foundation.
